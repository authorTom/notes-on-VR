# Notes on VR
## User Experience in VR
## Motion sickness
* All users are different, some get sick some don’t. <br />
* Rapid movement will make people feel sick. <br />
* If you have a horizon line keep it steady. <br />  
* Avoid rapid or abrupt transitions. <br />
* Blink locomotion helps with motion sickness. <br />
* Bright scenes are fatiguing. <br />
* Decide on your locomotion method, test, test, and test again. <br />
## Interfaces
* Interfaces need to exist within the game. Not just on top of he users vision <br />
* Menus and buttons will need to accommodate for the Field of View (FOV) of the headset. <br />
* Due to limited resolutions, buttons and text need to be obvious and easy to see. <br />
## Sound
* Sound design is very important; it needs to immerse your user and be spatial. <br />
## Normal Maps
* Normal Maps look different in VR <br />
* Due to stereoscopic vision, our eyes see Normal Maps as flat. <br />
* Normal Maps don’t have the same impact you see on flat games. <br />
* They are generally fine for small details but are not recommended for the larger. <br />
* Normal Maps may not be convincing enough. <br />
* You may need to use more geometry to give a sense of depth. <br />
